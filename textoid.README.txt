- fileless_textoid

- textoid

- fileless_textoid_handler

fileless_textoid<> is a class that can hold either a string
and/or a file offset to load a string from file or to store it.

It is the parent of class textoid<>.


Serialization of Strings
========================

A string is serialized to a text size by writing its size, a space and its contents.

A string is deserialized by reading its size, skipping a space character, and reading as many characters


Accomodating Long and Short Strings in a File
=============================================

Some long strings might overstep their initially alotted slot capacity.

fileless_textoid_handler<> handles this situation.

fileless_textoid_handler<> is a pretty sophisticated and involved piece of code.




PROJECTS

A Distributed Graph Chat Library
--------------------------------
Next, I would like to carry out a project ("Distributed Graph Chat Library") joining the following:
(1) A graph library for holding text-vertices and word-weighted edges (see "A Programmed Book")
(2) A graph serializer
(3) A chat client and server that can communicate part of a graph or whole graphs through serialization (see 2)
(4) Joint graph building
(5) Diagram generation and transmittable (SVG + XHTML)
