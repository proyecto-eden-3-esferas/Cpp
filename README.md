# Cpp

This repository contains some of my C++ code for:
- serialization and deserialization
- escaping characters to conform to formats such as SQL (escape apostrophe), XML (escape as entities), and so on
- XML and JSON classes
- graphs (relies on Boost.Graph)
- geometry (relies on Boost.Geometry)
